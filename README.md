# Project1 - Skate Part Picker App
For my Project 1 I have created a skateboard part picker app

It allows any user to create a skateboard and get the estimate price within their price range.

## About My Project
My project consists of 6 models. First one being users andd the other 5 being models relevant to a skateboard. 

The skate board model has a one to many association with all other models except the users model.

The user model has been implemented so that multiple users can log in on their own account and store multiple skateboard buidls.
