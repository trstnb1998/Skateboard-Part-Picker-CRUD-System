# 🛹 Project1 - Skate Part Picker App

For my Project 1, I have created a skateboard part picker app.

It allows any user to create a skateboard and get the estimated price within their price range.

## 📖 About My Project

My project consists of 6 models. The first one being users and the other 5 being models relevant to a skateboard.

The skateboard model has a one-to-many association with all other models except the users model.

The user model has been implemented so that multiple users can log in to their own account and store multiple skateboard builds.
